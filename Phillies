Algorithm:
  make an array with all of the data. Sort it from greatest to least then take the top 25 numbers and put it into a new array. 
  Then take the average of the new array resulting in the average of the highest top 25 salaries which would be the new guys salary.
  If the guy accepts the contract then *return the average as the value of his one year contract.
  If the guy denies it then *return "contract denied player going to sign with another team, you will recieve a draft pick"
